* 0.6.1 released, February 16, 2010
    * Translation
        - Added french translation - thanks to Filippo Rusconi.

* 0.6.0 released, February 14, 2010
    * Summary
        - Second game mode (Computer vs. Human)
        - Preferences dialog for persistent settings
        - Additional settings options
    * Preferences dialog
        - To examine all available settings options, a preferences dialog has been introduced.
        - The chosen preferences/settings are now persistent, so when starting the application, 
          the last used settings are applied.
    * Settings options
        - Game modes (Human vs Computer or Computer versus Human)
        - To get a fair chance you may select a weaker solver strength level for your computer 
          opponent ;-)
        - Let an impartial part :-) of your computer determine the corresponding hints for the 
          computer's guess. This option affects only Computer vs. Human games. If checked, you 
          only have to place your secret combination. Then the rest of the game runs automatically 
          until the end.
        - To better watch your computer trying hard to break your code, you may 
          define a timeout between the guesses 
        - Select letters or numbers as text indicators and - if convenient - do 
          not use colors as indicators at all - but it's still ColorCode ;-)
    * Layout/Design
        - Some minor changes and new buttons for the second game mode.
        

* 0.5.5 released, October 31, 2009
    * Summary
        - Accessibility and usability improvements
    * Settings options
        - For the color sensitive of us ;-) the posibility to change the color order by drag and drop 
          has been added.
        - Press CTRL while dragging to flip two colors or CTRL+SHIFT to cyclic shift the color order.
          You can do this even while a game is running - the whole existing display will change.
        - New 'Reset Color Order' option in the settings menu to revert your changes.
        - Also - and more important - for the more text aimed a settings option has been added, 
          to toggle the display of letter indicators for the different peg colors.
        - Make the documentations page accessible from the game's help menu.
    * Layout/Design
        - Some minor changes.
    
  
* 0.5 released, October 21, 2009
    * Summary
        - The number of columns in the game is now customizable. The column count can be any number 
          from 2 untill 5.
        - Updated translation files
    * Solver
        - Changed how the solver determines the first guess. Also - for the following really calculated 
          guesses - if the number of possibilities is very high (mostly at the early phase of a 10 colors/
          5 columns game) the solver will automatically fallback to a weaker algorithm until the number 
          of possibilities has been narrowed, to reduce calculating time
    * Layout/Design
        - Some minor changes to handle the variable number of columns. Added toolbar controls to enable 
          the change of all level related settings here. The statusbar now permanently shows the current 
          game's settings.


* 0.4 released, October 7, 2009
    * Summary
        - The GUI has been changed completely and the Usability was improved by adding some keyboard 
          shortcuts for often needed interactions.
        - Added czech translation. Thanks to Pavel Fric.
    * Fixes
        - To avoid those 'QGraphicsItem::ungrabMouse: not a mouse grabber' warnings emit the mouse event 
          only if the hint button hasn't been disabled just before ...
    * License
        - The License had been changed from the GPL v2 to GPL v3.
    * Layout/Design
        - Complete Change, so all paint methods had to be changed and optimized. The background is now 
          drawn by its own class, no more brushed metall background image anymore.


* 0.3 released, September 26, 2009
    * Summary
        - Introduced a rather perfect MasterMind solver. It will watch any move you take and any hints 
          you have gotten, so you can at any time in a running game let your computer guess for you. 
          Of course you can change or discard it's suggestion :-) .
    * Solver
        - The solver has 3 built in levels of stregth. For the suggestions, currently only the most 
          powerfull is used. For the first guess it will use a reasonable random guess based on pre-
          calculated combinations to reduce computation time.
    * Layout/Design
        - Make the solver's guess action accessible at the toolbar.


* 0.2 released, September 10, 2009
    * Summary
        - Added 3 levels of difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) based on the possibility to change the 
          available number of colors for a game. You can play games with 6, 8 or 10 colors.
    * Layout/Design
        - Added a combo-box (select) control to the toolbar, to easily access the level (color count) 
          settings. 
        - Enable hiding the menubar, toolbar and statusbar.
        - Changed to a centered layout (message display and game board).


* 0.1 released, September 6, 2009
    * Summary
        - This is the initial release of ColorCode, a free MasterMind clone. Try to guess a combination 
          of 8 colors within at most 10 guesses.
        - You may allow or not pegs of the same color. You can fill the rows by random or duplicate 
          a previous one.
    * GUI
        - English and German translations are available.
