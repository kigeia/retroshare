Solitaire is a solitaire game played with the standard 52 card deck.
The variations of the game all deal with how many cards are flipped
at once from the deck, and how many times the deck of cards can be
cycled through.  The variations are:</FONT></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">The
board is setup with seven stacks of cards, a deck of the remaining
cards, and four home stacks.  The goal is to move all cards to the
home stacks in ascending order from ace to king of the same suit. 
Cards are placed one at a time in order on the home stacks.  The
seven stacks of cards are dealt with each stack containing one more
card than the previous stack.  The first stack will contain one card
and the last of the seven will contain seven cards.  All cards in the
seven stacks are face down accept the top card.  Cards can be moved
between the stacks by placing red cards on black cards in descending
order from king to ace.  When a card is moved of a stack with a face
down card being exposed it will be flipped over automatically.  A
card can also be played on the home stack, if it is an ace or the
next card in ascending order of a suit in one of the home stacks. 
Once moves are exhausted on the board the next set of cards can be
flipped over from the deck.  The top card in the flipped over cards
from the deck can be played using the same rules described for the
stacks.  Play will continue until all moves are exhausted or until
all cards are moved to the home stacks and the game is won.  </FONT></FONT>
