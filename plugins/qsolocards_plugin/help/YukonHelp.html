Solitaire is a solitaire game played with the standard 52 card deck.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">The
board is setup with seven stacks of cards, and four home stacks. The
goal is to move all cards to the home stacks in ascending order from
ace to king of the same suit. Cards are placed one at a time in order
on the home stacks. The seven stacks of cards are dealt. The first
stack has just one face up card.  The remaining have one ( second
stack ) increasing to six ( seventh stack ) cards face down and five
cards face up.  Cards can be moved between the stacks by placing red
cards on black cards in ascending order ( You can move cards as deep
in the a stack as you wish. The red to black ascending relationship
only applies to the top card being moved and the last card in the
stack to which it is moved. ).  When a card is moved of a stack with
a face down card being exposed it will be flipped over automatically.
A card can also be played on the home stack, if it is an ace or the
next card in ascending order of a suit in one of the home stacks.
Once moves are exhausted on the board the next set of cards can be
flipped over from the deck. The top card in the flipped over cards
from the deck can be played using the same rules described for the
stacks. Play will continue until all moves are exhausted or until all
cards are moved to the home stacks and the game is won. </FONT></FONT>
