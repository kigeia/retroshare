3.0 has a lot of new features, a lot of polishing went into it, let's see the changes.

Changes in 3.0:

-Added Estonian translation thanks to Jefim Borissov.

-New storing modes, since many people consider storing data in text files primitive, qOrganizer v3.0 lets you choose what storing mode you want.You can choose between text files, an SQLite database or you could connect to a MySQL server over the network, the choice is yours.

-Ability to save between storing modes. If you stored all your data in text files you can browse through all your schedules and press Save to SQLite database(on the toolbar) for the ones you want to save if you change the storing mode to SQLite, same goes for MySQL.
Although you can move all your data between storing modes, I advise you to keep the storing mode you currently use, text files are fast,
SQLite database is slower for the intensive saving operations of Autosave, but Autosave can be disabled.

Note:The user and password of the MySQL server is stored on the local machine unencrypted so don't use any important MySQL servers.

-You can switch between storing modes without restarting the program.

-Search function, now you can search through all your schedules and journals it will cycle between results, when you hit the clear button in the right part of the line edit it will jump back to the current date.

-The settings dialog get cleaned up, now it's more well organized, using tabs.

-Now the column widths set by the user are stored and reset when the program restarts

-University (college) students requested that I incorporate a feature that allows one to keep and switch between two timetables, one for even weeks (example:week 36) and one of odd weeks (example:week 37).It's a common habit of universities to use different timetables depending on the parity of the week index.Now qOrganizer does this.This feature can be disabled, also the normal order of weeks can be reversed, depending on what week does the university consider odd or even.

-Drag and drop support for images in the journal. Now you can just open konqueror(or explorer) select one of your favorite images and just drag and drop it onto the journal for that day, it will be displayed and saved.

-Fixed some bugs in the printing functions, now every title string is translated, and when printing the booklet the mark table is next to the absence table, not under.

-Removed all xpm icons, switched to png, and replaced the toolbar icons with original nuvoX 0.7 icons (nuvoX 0.7 iconset was released under the GPL by Xavier Corredor Lliano, whom I thanks for this).

-Added slightly modded nuvoX icons to save between storing modes to the toolbar.

-Moved every setting to ini file in .qOrganizer folder, generated by QSettings (well except one, the path to .qOrganizer is stored in the registry with QSettings, or .config under Linux).No more config.txt.
 And now you can switch between storing folders, the correct data and the settings from the ini file in that folder will be loaded, you don't need to restart the program. 

-Added dates to mark table, now you can assign a date to any mark, if there is no date assigned the current date will be shown, this can be stored in text files and database too, depending on your storing mode. I didn't insert this in the table, but added a QDateEdit next to the average fields, so it won't confuse you in the table.

-Added "Thanks to" tab in the about dialog with the name of the contributors.

-Fixed bugs along the way.

-Added Albanian and Macedonian translation thanks to Driton Bakiu.

-Added Spanish translation by Nicolas Schubert.

Now available translations:Russian (thanks to Evgeniy Ivanov), Portuguese (thanks to Luis Bastos), Slovenian (thanks to Blaz Kure),Estonian(thanks to Jefim Borissov), Albanian and Macedonian (thanks to Driton Bakiu), Spanish(thanks to Nicolas Schubert), Hungarian and Romanian (done by me).

2.1 is a bugfix release.
I am planning to make pretty radical changes to the code (like adding SQLite support to store data), school is close, the vacation is comming to an end, I don't know when I'll get those implemented so I thought I'll make a bugfix release for 2.0 to get rid of the most annoying bugs.

Changes in 2.1:

-Fixed that ugly bug that occures the first time when you run qOrganizer, the bug that causes the main window to not appear until you quit (this was Windows only)
-Enforced UTF8 on the config file too, so now if you have an UTF8 character in your path, it won't cause problems.
-Updated Portuguese translation.
-Made the to-do list and the timetable a lot bigger in size, so now the progress bar in the Completed column is more detailed even on Windows.
-Added saving, and jumping to the current date even when the window is hidden by clicking the systray icon.

That's all folks.
Enjoy!

The new release of qOrganizer comes loaded with many sweet features and is more polished than the previous releases.
The version number 2.0 is well deserved considering all improvements compared to 1.0.

Changes in 2.0:

-Average calculation implemented to deal with subjects separately and recalculate average for the subject when the row changes in the
mark table. Also added a textfield containing the total average (all averages are rounded and their average is calculated)

-Added the ability to change the date format displayed (thanks for the patch to Evgeniy Ivanov (powerfox))

-Added a feature for uploading and downloading all data files stored by the program to a remote ftp server.
So when you go on holyday (I know it's late know :D) you just provide the details to access the ftp server hit the download button and you have immediate access to all data stored by qOrganizer.

BIG FAT NOTE: Do not use an important ftp server for this feature, also don't use untrusted ftp servers to upload sensitive data (because all data is stored unencrypted on the server).
If you are not sure that your computer is secure do not use this feature because the password to the ftp server is stored on the local machine.
I can not be hold responsible for any damage caused by this software.This program is provided WITHOUT WARRANTY, read the file COPYING for details.
But normally you should be okay. 

-Added support for non Latin charsets :)
(again thanks to Evgeniy Ivanov for figuring this out and submitting a patch)

-Corrected some memory leaks.

-Added custom delegates in the tables to improve usability and the intuitively of the interface.

-Added extra menus, and made everything accessible from the menu (or with keyboard shortcuts)

-Added an option to reload data when the view changes.
This feature was suggested by Blaz Kure, it improves using multiple computers with one folder of settings stored on a network drive.

-Added a column labeled Start to represent the date when a task was started.

-Made the timetable headers translatable.

-Added sound to reminders, when a reminder hits a sound is played.
I used a sound from k3b, since it's under GPL, the file named:k3b_success1.wav.
Of course this setting can be turned off in the settings dialog.

-A lot of bug fixes!

-Added translations: Portuguese (thanks to Luis Bastos (http://programaslivres.net/)), Slovenian (thanks to Blaz Kure), Russian (thanks to Evgeniy Ivanov).

BIG THANKS TO ALL TRANSLATORS :)
AND A SPECIAL THANKS TO Evgeniy Ivanov for his contributions. 

Please back up the .qOrganizer folder before upgrading, the to-do list will be broken because of the new Start column, everything else should be fine.Of course adjust all settings.

If you encounter any bugs please report them on the projects sourceforge (btw: thanks to SourceForge for hosting the project and for excellent services) page:
