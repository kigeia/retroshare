Compling for Windows.
-----------------------------------
For Version V0.5.0+ we are switching to GPGme libraries.

You will need:
 * Qt4.5 Development Libraries (from TrollTech)
 * MinGw/MinSys full installation (from sourceforge.net)
 * OpenSSL standard libraries.
 * GPG Windows Install (includes gpg.exe)
 * MiniUpnp library
 * gpgme Library.


1) First install the MinGW/Msys package from.

2) Install Qt4.5, when it asks for MinGW, 
  point it at the package installed in step 1).

3) Compile OpenSSL using MinGW.

4) Compile MiniUPnP.

5) Compile gpg-error

6) Compile gpgme

7) Compile libretroshare

8) Compile GUI.


I will flesh out these instructions with time.
