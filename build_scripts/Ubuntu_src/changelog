retroshare (0.5.3-0.XXXXXX~YYYYYY) YYYYYY; urgency=low

  * Improvements
     - removed minimal version
     - Improved TR routing strategy:
        * updated base forward probabilities to larger values
        * used a minimum FP to 1/nb_connected_friends instead of 0. This is the larger non-explosive value.
        * changed tunnel management time to 2 secs instead of 1, setting the overall number of TR/s emmitted 
          for all downloads to 0.5 (Should reduce the TR load for the whole network by a factor of 2).
     - Activate DHTML in Doxygen Documentation, for Fold in/out Class hierarchy images.
     - New Doxygen configuratin for Retroshare GUI, see at
         http://notdefine.de/retroshare/retroshare/trunk/retroshare-gui/src/html/index.html
     - Add missing includes "unistd.h" for compiling with gcc 4.7.0. (Patch from AC)

     - don't remove color and font when the last char is deleted from the chat text entry box (Patch from AC)
     - Fixed, hide "Accept Friend Request" Button for Unknown Peers
     - Improved Search Dialog (Patch from AsamK)
        * don't add friend sources count to anonymous count each time a result for the same file is received!, this could 
          lead to enormously large sources numbers
        * don't readd search in summary list if it was already removed by the user
        * don't clear the filter when new search results are added
        * when using the file name filter only show result from the current search, not also from previous searches
        * fixed adding only file types which were searched for, for this I created a new hidden column in summary list to store the file type
        * fixed sorting by file size/age, pad string with '0' instead of ' ' Search feature: a quirk I've found
        * decrease gui hanging:
           -when adding search results temporarily disable sorting
           -only add 250 instead of 500 items in one go
           -don't call selectSearchResults() for each item added to the result list; instead call hideOrShowSearchResult() 
            which only sets the hidden status of the added item, not the complete list
           -replace std::string with QString, removes unnecessary conversions
     - Fixed clickable links in forum message feed.

retroshare (0.5.2-0.4747~natty) natty; urgency=low

  * Improvements
     - Added the real size of all files of a collection to the link when added with drag and drop.
     - ConnectionFriendWizard: Show the messagebox "Your Cert is copied to Clipboard" after copying the cert into the clipboard.
     - Removed "release" from the win32 build in retroshare-nogui.pro.
     - Added retroshare-nogui to the subdir project.

     - DHT (Merging r4705 through r4717 from retroshare/branches/v0.5-dhtmods)
       * Switched on Local BadPeer DHT Filter.
          - This will remove any peer detected to be spoofing yourself or your friends.
          - This list is also shared with you friends. (in Test Mode).
       * Added Cleanup of BadPeer Filter.
          - Instead of permanent ban, peers are be banned for 6 hours.
          - bdManager periodically calls this - which prints out ban list too.
       * Added Checks against spoofing to UdpStunner.

     - Added new common class FilesDefs to handle informations of file types like icons and names.
     - Removed calls to exit() in rsinit. Replaced them by proper return false
     - Adjustment of some values for file transfer: some delays can be larger, now that chunks are shared between sources. This makes file transfer more stable:
        FT_TM_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT: 10 -> 20 secs (RTT limit of 10 secs is too low -> transfers in long tunnels kept switching between active and inactive)
        INACTIVE_CHUNKS_CHECK_DELAY: 60 -> 240 secs (Chunks are kept longer before beign cancelled, which is now affordable)
        MAX_TIME_INACTIVE_REQUEUED: 60 -> 120 secs.(Transfers a kept longer before being re-prioritized in queue)

  * Bug fixes
     - Added the size of the collection to the link only for files (missing test)
     - Show the correct name in the title of the RsCollectionDialog when the filename contains ".".
     - Fixed creating of the download path of the collection when running as portable version.

      - TcoOnUdp code:
         * Reduce Maximum Transmission size from 1500 -> 1000. This is the cause of Failed Connections.
