  PDN Format:   For storing the positions of games KCheckers uses the 
                Portable Draughts Notation (PDN) database format. It is
                used by many other checkers programs, and is becoming
                the standard way to swap games.

                PDN is based on the Portable Game Notation (PGN) standard
                which is widely used for Chess.
